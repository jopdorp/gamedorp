gb-rs
=====

Game Boy emulator written in rust. No unsafe code so far.

The CPU passes all the instruction tests as well as all the timing
tests (see the "Ressources" section below for the links to the tests).

Saving is implemented, it creates a file with the ".sav" extension in
the same directory as the ROM being executed if it supports saving.

Sound is implemented with adaptative resampling to match the sound
card sample rate. Note that it might take a few seconds for the
algorithm to settle on the correct sample rate so you might get a few
dropped sound packets when you start the emulator. Normally once this
training time has elapsed there should be no drops.

The sound unit is not completely accurate however, some games have
weird glitches in the sounds (The Legend of Zelda in particular). I'm
working on that...

Things that remain to be implemented:
* Serial link
* Support for various types of cartridges
* Maybe GameBoy Color support?

The emulator is not optimized at all but thanks to the GB's measly
4Mhz system clock it should run at speed on any half-decent desktop
CPU. Don't forget to build with ```cargo --release``` do enable the
optimizations however.

The display and input are handled through SDL2. That code is modular
and abstracted away from the emulator core so it shouldn't be
difficult to add support for alternative backends if need be.

The controls are hardcoded in `src/ui/sdl2/controller.rs` at the
moment: you'll have to edit the `update_key`, `update_button` and
`update_axis` function if you want to rebind the various keyboard and
controller controls.

The defaults are:

| GameBoy button  | Keyboard      | Controller             |
| --------------- | ------------- | ---------------------- |
| A               | Left Alt      | A                      |
| B               | Left Control  | B                      |
| Start           | Return        | Start                  |
| Select          | Right Shift   | Back                   |
| Up              | Up            | DPadUp    / LeftY axis |
| Down            | Down          | DPadDown  / LeftY axis |
| Left            | Left          | DPadLeft  / LeftX axis |
| Right           | Right         | DPadRight / LeftX axis |

The `Escape` key exits the emulator.

By default the emulator is built with the original Gameboy bootrom
which scrolls the logo down the screen before actually jumping into
the game. By building with the `--features sgb_bootrom` option you can
opt to use the Super Game Boy bootrom instead which is much faster to
boot up.

An introduction to GB emulation in Javascript:
http://imrannazar.com/GameBoy-Emulation-in-JavaScript:-The-CPU

There are many small errors or discrepancies in the docs listed above,
unfortunately I don't know if/how those docs are maintained so I'm
going to list the errors I've found here for now:

* `RLCA` instruction: various sources disagree on whether the `Z` flag
  should be modified by the operation. After some research I'm pretty
  sure it shouldn't be modified (the Z80 processor for instance does
  not modify `Z`).

* `HALT` instruction: when this instruction is executed while
  interrupts are disabled in the CPU (for instance by a `DI`
  instruction) the CPU will still be awoken by any interrupt enabled
  in the `IE` register, however the interrupt handler will *not* be
  run and the control will be given back to the code that called the
  `HALT`. Be careful that the instruction following an `HALT` is
  glitchy but that's well documented.

* `ADD SP,N` (opcode 0xe8) and `LDHL SP,N` (opcode 0xf8): the values
  of the carry and halfcarry are computed on the low 8bits.

* `RLCA`, `RLA`, `RRCA`, `RRA` instructions: the flags are described
   wrong in the CPU manual: after the execution `C` contains the
   rotated bit while `N`, `H` and `Z` are always 0. The equivalent
   instructions in the extended `CB` opcode space however set `Z` if
   the result is 0 and that's correctly documented.

* Instruction timings: The GameBoy CPU manual gets all the timings of
  conditional branches wrong: it doesn't say that the number of cycles
  taken by the instruction to execute depends on whether or not the
  branch is taken. More generally, both this manual and the opcode map
  linked above have some discrepencies when it comes to instruction
  timings. In the end it's probably safer to use the timings directly
  from the assembly source for the accuracy tests.

* The actual state machine for the configurable GPU LCD interrupt
  seems not well described anywhere. I tried to put a lot of comments
  in my code to describe my approach, however I'm not sure whether
  it's 100% accurate.

* When there are more than 10 sprites on a line only the 10 first in
  OAM order are displayed. The sprite's X coordinates and priority
  don't matter, only the position in OAM.
